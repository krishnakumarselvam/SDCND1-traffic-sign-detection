## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, the goal is to train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

Here are the relevant files. Note (I split up the proect into 3 notebooks for readability)

* Ipython notebooks
	* [Part 1 - Data processing and augmentation](Part_1_Data_processing_and_augmentation.ipynb)
	* [Part 2 - Training the classifier](Part_2_building_model.ipynb)
	* [Part 3 - Model diagnostics](Part_3_Model_diagnostics.ipynb)
* the code exported as an html file
* [write up](writeup_template.md)
